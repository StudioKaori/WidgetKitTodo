##How to update iOS widget with API?

To update the widget with API, the service should be added to the widget, see the left column of your service.
This case,
WidgetKitTodo > Data > TodoService
Left panel > ‘Target membership’ > tick 'WidgetKitTodoWidgetExtension'

Todo model also should be added to the widget extension target.
